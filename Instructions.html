<h3>The Assignment</h3>
To write a simple shell in C with the following "built-in" commands.
<br>
<h4>Overview</h4>

A shell has a loop that prints a prompt, consisting of a
"prefix," which is initially an empty string, followed by 
'<code> [cwd]&gt; </code>', where <code>cwd</code> is the "current working
directory," and executes commands until the <code>exit</code> command is
entered.  In the loop, the shell checks if the command is one of the
built-in commands (given below) or an executable (external command) in the search
path.  The shell needs to pass arguments to the external commands (i.e.,
build an <code>argv</code> array).  If the command entered is neither
one of the built-in commands nor in the search paths, the shell prints
"<code>command</code>: Command not found." where <code>command</code> is the
command name that was entered.
<h4>More Details</h4>
<ol>
  <li> Obviously, the shell needs to parse the command line entered.
    A good way to do this would be to use <code>fgets(3)</code> to read in the (entire)
    command line, then use <code>strtok(3)</code> with a space as the delimiter.
    The first "word" will be the command (where we'll ignore the possibility that a
    command could have a space in its name).  All the "words" after that are
    arguments to be passed to the command (which the shell needs to put into a <code>char**</code>).  
    Check out <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/sample-code/parse-cmd.c">parse-cmd.c</a>
    to see how this is done.
    <code>fgets()</code> returns NULL on error or when end
    of file (EOF) occurs while no characters have been read.
    </li>
  <li> After you get the command, check if it is one of the built-in commands
    (explained below). If it is, then perform the corresponding function for that.</li>
  <li> If it is not one of the built-in commands, check if it is an <b>absolute path</b> (a
    command begins with '<code>/</code>') or a path begins with '<code>./</code>', '<code>../</code>', etc., and run that if it is an executable
    (use <code>access(2)</code> to check).</li>
  <li> If the command is neither of the above cases then search for the
    command in the search path by looping through the paths stored as a <b>linked
    list</b> as given in <code>get_path.c</code> in the
    <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/skeleton-code">skeleton code</a>. (You may 
    <code>gcc get_path.c get_path_main.c</code> and run the
    generated <code>a.out</code> to see what happends.)
    You may also use your own linked list code.
    Use <code>access(2)</code> in a loop to find the first executable
    in the paths for the command.
    <code>snprintf(3)</code> would be useful here (as using <code>strcat()</code>
    has caused problems for some people).</li>
  <li> Once you find the (external) command, you should execute it by ullingsing 
    <code>execve(2)</code>. 
    Review <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/sample-code/execve_ls.c">execve_ls.c</a> to see
    how <code>execve(2)</code> should be invoked.
    The shell should also execute
    <code>waitpid(2)</code> and print out the return status of the command if
    it is nonzero like <code>tcsh</code> does when the 
    <code>printexitvalue</code> shell variable is set. Look into using the
    WEXITSTATUS macro from 
    <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/wait.html">
    &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</a>.</li>
  <li> Before executing a command, the shell should also print out what it
    is about to execute. (i.e. print "Executing [<em>pathname</em>]"; for built-in commands,
    print "Executing built-in [<em>built-in command name</em>]").</li>
  <li> The shell needs to support the <code>*</code> wildcard character when a single <code>*</code> is given.
    You do not need to handle the situation when <code>*</code> is given with a <code>/</code> in the
    string (i.e., /usr/include/*.h).
    This should work just like it does in csh/tcsh when <code>noglob</code> is not set.
    The shell need only to support the
    possibility of one <code>*</code> on the command line, but it could have characters
    prepended and/or appended.  (That is, <code>ls *</code> should work correctly 
    as should <code>ls *.c</code>, <code>ls s*</code>, <code>ls
    p*.txt</code>, etc.) Hint: implement
    the <code>list</code> built-in command explained below before attempting this.
    You may use <code>glob(3)</code> or <code>wordexp(3)</code>if you wish.
    [Review <code>glob.c</code> in 
    <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/sample-code">sample code</a>.]
    <font color="red">Note that it is the shell's responsibility
    to expand wildcards to matching (file) names.</font>
    (Review <code>wildcard-1.c</code> in
    <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/sample-code">sample code</a>.)
    <font color="red">If there were no matches, the "original"
    arguments are passed to <code>execve()</code>.</font> 
    <font color="blue">The shell would
    only need to make the wildcard to work with external commands.</font>
    </li>
<!--
  <li> You also need to support the <code>?</code> wildcard character which should match
    any single character (exactly one character match) in a filename
    (anywhere in the filename).  The <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> should also work together.
    </li>
-->
  <li> When a user presses Control-C (Ctrl-C), the SIGINT signal is sent
    to all processes in the <em>foreground process group</em>.
    SIGINT should be caught and ignored by 
    the shell to prompt for commands, but terminates the 
    running child process otherwise.  Use <code>signal(2)</code> and/or
    <code>sigset(3)</code> for this.  Ctrl-Z (SIGTSTP) and SIGTERM
    should be ignored using <code>sigignore(3)</code> or
    <code>signal(2)</code>.  Check out sample code
    <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/sample-code/signal_Z.c">sleep_Z.c</a>.
    <font color="red">Note that when a user is running a command
    (executable) inside
    the shell and presses control-C, signal SIGINT is sent to both
    the shell process and the running command process
    (i.e., all the processes in the <em>foreground</em>
    process group).</font>
    (Review Sections 9.4 (Process Groups), 9.5 (Sessions), and
    9.6 (Controlling Terminal) of Stevens and Rago's 
    <a href="http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/unix/9780321638014">APUE book</a> for details.)
    </li>
  <li> The shell should treat Ctrl-D and the 
  <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/eof.htm">EOF</a> char in a similar way csh/tcsh
    do when the <code>ignoreeof</code> 
    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-tcsh/">tcsh shell variable</a> is set, i.e., ignore it,
    instead of exiting or seg-faulting.  Note that Ctrl-D is not a signal,
    but the EOF char. If <code>ignoreeof</code> is set to the empty string or '0' and the input device is a terminal, the end-of-file command (usually generated by the user by typing '^D' on an empty line)
    causes the shell to print 'Use "exit" to leave tcsh.' instead of exiting. This prevents the shell from accidentally being killed. If set to a number n, the shell ignores n - 1 consecutive end-of-files and exits on the nth. 
    If unset, '1' is used, i.e. the shell exits on a single '^D'. 
    Review all the
    <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/~casterln/tcsh/Special_shell_variables.html">shell variables of tcsh</a>. 
    (Please review the <b><em>difference</em></b> between
    <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/26318/environment-variable-vs-shell-variable-whats-the-difference">Shell Variables and Environment Variables</a>.) 
    You may also review 
    <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/sample-code/fgets_ctrl_D.c">this code</a> to see
    how <code>fgets()</code> works with EOF. </li>
  <li> Your code should do proper error checking. Again, check man pages for
    error conditions, and call <code>perror(3)</code> as needed.  Also
    avoid memory leaks by calling <code>free(3)</code> as needed.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Built-in Commands to support</h4>
<ul>
  <li> <b><code>exit</code></b> - obvious!</li>
  <li> <b><code>which</code></b> - same as the tcsh one (hint: you can write a
  function to do this and use it for finding the command to execute)
  [Review <code>get_path_main.c</code> in
  <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/skeleton-code">shell skeleton code</a> for details]</li>
  <li> <b><code>where</code></b> - same as the tcsh one (reports all
       known instances of <i>command</i> in path)
  [Review <code>get_path_main.c</code> in
  <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/skeleton-code">shell skeleton code</a>]</li>
       
  <li> <b><code>cd</code></b> - <code>chdir(2)</code> to the directory given; with no arguments,
       chdir to the home directory; with a '-' as the only argument, chdirs to directory
       <b>previously in</b>, the same as what tcsh does. [Review Stevens and Rago's Section 4.23 for details and <font color="blue">the reason why cd has to be implemented as a built-in command</font>]</li>
  <li> <b><code>pwd</code></b> - print the current working directory.
       [Review <code>getcwd.c</code> in
       <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/sample-code">sample code</a>;
       review Stevens and Rago's Section 4.23 for details]</li>
  <li> <b><code>list</code></b> - with no arguments, lists the files in the
       current working directory one per line.  With arguments, lists the files in
       each directory given as an argument, with a blank line then the name
       of the directory followed by a : before the list of files in that
       directory.   You will need to use <code>opendir(3)</code> and
       <code>readdir(3)</code>. (Hint: read their respective man pages carefully,
       and refer to Fig. 1.3 of Stevens and Rago's APUE book)</li>
  <li> <b><code>pid</code></b> - prints the pid of the shell</li>
  <li> <b><code>kill</code></b> - When given just a pid, sends a SIGTERM to
       the process with that pid using <code>kill(2)</code>.  When given a signal number (with a -
       in front of it), sends that signal to the pid. 
       (e.g., <code>kill 5678</code>, <code>kill -9 5678</code>).
       Read the man page of <code>kill(2)</code> to check for
       return value of -1 on error and the 'errno' value of ESRCH (3)
       for "No such process."
       </li>
  <li> <b><code>prompt</code></b> - When ran with no arguments, prompts for
       a new prompt prefix string.  When given an argument make that the
       new prompt prefix. For instance, let's assume <code>cwd</code>
       is <code>/usa/cshen</code>.</li>
<pre> [/usa/cshen]&gt; prompt CISC361
CISC361 [/usa/cshen]&gt; _
CISC361 [/usa/cshen]&gt; cd 361
CISC361 [/usa/cshen/361]&gt; prompt YES
YES [/usa/cshen/361]&gt; prompt
  input prompt prefix: hello
hello [/usa/cshen/361]&gt; _
</pre>
  <li> <b><code>printenv</code></b> - Should work the same as the tcsh
       built-in one.  When ran with no arguments, prints the whole environment.
       (This can be done in 2 lines of code, a <code>printf()</code> inside
       of a <code>while</code> loop by accessing the extern
       <code>environ</code> variable, not counting a variable 
       declaration).
       When ran with one argument, call <code>getenv(3)</code> on it.  When
       called with two or more args, print the same error message to stderr
       that tcsh does.
       (Review Stevens and Rago's Section 7.5 Environment List [and
       Section 7.4 Command-Line Arguments] for details.) </li>
<!--
  <li> <b><code>alias</code> </b> - Should work the same as the tcsh
       built-in one.  When ran with no arguments prints the aliases the
       shell knows about.  When ran with arguments it should install an
       alias into the alias table the shell knows about.  Additionally,
       the shell needs to be able to run your aliases to receive full
       credit.  Supply your own test cases to show that it works. </li>
  <li> <b><code>history</code> </b> - Should print the last <em>n</em> commands (by
       default <em>n</em> is 10) executed when ran with no options.  When ran with
       a numerical argument changes the number of commands to list to that
       number. [No need to save history across shell sessions.]
-->
  <li> <b><code>setenv</code></b> - 
       Should work the same as the tcsh built-in one.  When ran with no
       arguments, prints the whole environment, the same as 
       <code>printenv</code>.  When ran with one argument, sets that as
       an empty environment variable.  When ran with two arguments, the
       second one is the value of the first.  When ran with more args,
       print the same error message to stderr that tcsh does.  You can
       use the <code>setenv(3)</code> function for this command.
       Special care must be given when PATH and HOME are changed.  When
       PATH is changed, be sure to update your linked list for the path
       directories (and <code>free()</code> up the old one).  When HOME is changed,
       <code>cd</code> with no arguments should now go to the new home.  
       (Review Stevens and Rago's <a href="http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/unix/9780321638014/7dot-process-environment/ch07lev1sec9_html">Section 7.9 Environment Variables</a> for details.) </li>
<!--
  <li> <b><code>copy</code> </b> -
       Should work the same as '<code>cp -i file1 file2</code>'.  When ran
       with anything other than two arguments it should print an error
       message.  This needs to be implemented using the <code>open(2),
       read(2), write(2) and close(2)</code> system calls.  You may find the
       <code>access(2)</code> system call useful also.
       Test with different size files and with file2 existing and
       not existing.  Be sure to test where file2 exists and is bigger than
       file1.  Provide your own test cases.
       </li>
-->
</ul> 

<h4>How to get started</h4>
It is recommendated to first get the loop working to find a command, i.e.,
implement <code>which</code> first.  Then you will be able to create a new process
with <code>fork(2)</code> and use <code>execve(2)</code> in the child process
and <code>waitpid(2)</code> in the parent.  Then handle arguments and do
the other built-ins.  Remember to the read man pages for
system and library calls, include the corresponding header files.
<br><br>
A skeleton code to get started with is <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/skeleton-code">here</a>.
Example code of using <code>fork(2)</code> and <code>exec(2)</code>
can be found <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/sample-code">here</a>.
<br>

<h4>Some more library functions that may be helpful</h4>
<code>atoi(3), fprintf(3), index(3), calloc(3), malloc(3), 
memcpy(3), memset(3), getcwd(3), strncmp(3),  strlen(3).
</code>

<h4> About <code>which</code> and <code>where</code></h4>

The best way to learn how the <code>which</code> and <code>where</code> commands work is to use the
following 3 programs (that are part of the Shell skeleton code) to
create an executable as follows.
<pre>get_path.c    get_path.h    get_path_main.c
</pre>

<pre>$ gcc get_path.c get_path_main.c
$ ./a.out
</pre>

In <b>tcsh</b>, you can append a directory called /usr/local/bin to the END of search path by entering the following command and then print the new value.
<pre>$ set path = ($path /usr/local/bin)
$ echo $path
</pre>

To add the directory to the FRONT of search path, do
<pre>$ set path = (/usr/local/bin $path)
</pre>

In <b>bash</b>, to add the directory to the END of search path, do 
<pre>$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
</pre>

To add to the FRONT of path, do
<pre>$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</pre>

Both <code>which</code> and <code>where</code> will start searching for the target executable from the front of the path/PATH value.

<h3>Test Runs</h3>

<h3>Notes </h3>
<ul>
<li> Please run your shell under <code>valgrind --leak-check=full</code> 
     to check for any memory leaks.
</li><li> The next project builds upon this project.  It is important to have
minimal functionality of this project in order to complete the next
project. 
</li></ul>

<!--
<h3>Extra Credits (5 points) </h3>
Turn your shell into one that will restrict the execution time of
a running command (process). Your shell will execute a command as a
new process, but if the process exceeds a 'timeout' value in seconds,
it will be killed.  You will start your shell with one argument
stating the timeout value (in seconds).  For instance,
<pre>
$ ./myshell 5
mysh >>
mysh >> cat
!!! taking too long to execute this command !!!
mysh >>
mysh >>
</pre>
<font color="red">You may NOT use multi-threading to implement
this feature.</font>
-->

<h3>Grading </h3>
<ul>
  <li> 90% correctly working shell
       (<a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/PA_3_Simple_Shell/checklist.html">checklist</a>)</li>
  <li> 10% documentation and code structure (remember to check error
 situations and avoid too much duplicate code)</li>
<!---
  <li> Have your completed project turned in to the TA (email, hard copy and
  demo scheduled) by September 27 and receive <b>five (5) extra credit
   points.</b></li>
  <li>If you would like to demo your project to the TA rather than have them
   grade it on their own schedule a time with the TA to do so.
    </li>
-->
</ul>

<h3>Turn In </h3>

<!--
Turn in all of your code, a script of the test runs (show doing a `make
clean' followed by a make to build your shell) for Solaris (it should also
work for Linux) for your well documented program by email to the TA in a tar
file.  No hard copy is needed.  The only thing that needs to be printed out
is the <a href="checklist.html">checklist</a> which you should take with you
to the demo with the TA.
-->
<p>
You need to tar up your source code, test run script file, etc.
To do this, do the following.

</p><ul>
<li> In the current working directory, create a 
(sub-)directory named <code>proj3</code> to store all your programs.

</li><li>
<pre>tar cvf YourName_proj3.tar proj3</pre> 
</li></ul>

To verify that your files are in the tar file take a look at the table of
contents of the tar file like:
<pre>tar tvf YourName_proj3.tar
</pre>
